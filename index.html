                        <p>Thrills galore Because of its marine location, the Maldives boasts every kind of water-based adventure sport from paddling around a lagoon in a transparent hulled canoe to being propelled several metres below the surface of the sea by underwater scooter, or gliding several metres above the surface dangling from a parachute behind a speedboat.  For the energetic and adventurous, the Maldives is just as rewarding a destination as it is for the laidback sun worshiper or sophisticated epicure. With 99% of its territory being sea, the Maldives is one of the world’s leading watersports hubs with its environment of islands and turquoise blue waters forming the perfect combination for a natural watersports arena. All the resorts and the inhabited islands popular with tourists have a watersports centre of some kind, either with a fleet of windsurf boards, sails and other equipment, or just a couple of wakeboards.</p>

                        <p>Having fun in the Maldives The Maldives is unusual as a holiday destination because of the fun things to do whether you are staying on a plush resort, in Male’, or in a simple guesthouse on an island in a faraway atoll. Entertainment and daily excursions are organised at every resort so don’t be shy about joining in. Excursions will include fishing and cruising (to watch dolphins dance) as well as visits to the capital, Male’, and to genuinely deserted islands, perhaps for swimming and a picnic, and shopping expeditions to neighboring inhabited islands. If you stay in a guesthouse on an inhabited island, you will have the chance to meet Maldivians, experience local culture and cuisine, and join in what the islanders do for relaxation, such as playing football in the late afternoon or relaxing over a soft drink and eating “short eats” (small snacks) in a seaside café.

                    <h3>The Maldivian Side Of Life</h3>
                    <p>Getting to know the Maldives The Maldives offers so much more than sand, sun and sea as the islands are blessed with a rich culture and heritage. A holiday in the Maldives is a chance to gain an insight into this unique country, by exploring island villages, sourcing local handicrafts, visiting heritage sites and the National Museum, tasting local cuisine, and watching cultural performances. With a total area approximately the size of Portugal but a land area comprising islands and sandbanks about the size of Singapore, islanders were isolated from each other by the ocean that forms over 99% of the country. Their self-sufficiency is reflected in the implements and clothes they fashioned for themselves, which have become today’s handicrafts, and in agriculture. Some islands are very fertile, lush with mangroves and with interior ponds. Every island supports vegetation of some kind with coconuts somehow managing to thrive in a […]</p>

                        <p>Perfect Privacy For couples, a romantic holiday in the Maldives is a chance to be together in a way that never happens at home. Accommodation on a resort is not just a room, it’s a private love nest designed for the romantic. Villas are secluded in lush vegetation or isolated above a lagoon. The interior décor is soft, muted tones of distinction, the furnishings are impeccable, the bed is large and blissfully comfortable, the bathroom luxurious. Gaze from the veranda to a panoramic view of the lagoon lapping the beach and of coconut palms waving on the shore. Even the breeze seems to whisper romance. Just as there are resorts more suitable for families with children or for enthusiastic divers, there are also resorts designed for those in love, whether beginning life together, renewing their vows, celebrating a wedding anniversary, commemorating their years of partnership, or simply wanting to get […]</p>

There are an estimated 110 top quality spas at island resorts plus some spas in Male’ and even one in the public terminal at the Ibrahim Nasir International Airport, as well as informal ones catering to guests staying on inhabited islands.</p>
